# Healthcare-project--1
This is healthcare data analysis project taken to deepen my skill in data analysis.

# Documentation
The data was an Excel sheet downloaded from Kaggle which is an improvised healthcare data for practice. It had 16 columns and 55501 rows of health information. Only columns  relevant to the analysis were considered. Data cleaning and manipulation were done to remove irrelevant columns, data types changed, date data type adjustments to extract number of  days were done.

# Key Insights
A total of 1.42 billion was spent settling health insurance costs within the 5-year period  which covered 2019 to 2024. There was a sudden spike in spending late 2019 to early 2020 and the pattern was replicated amongst all 5 insurance providers that were a part of the scheme.40 thousand doctors and 40 thousand hospitals were assessed within the specified period and over 860 thousand days were spent by patients on admission cumulatively.
Most of the insurance cost (over 98%) was expended on the active population which are people 25years to below 49years and those 50years to below 75years while the rest was shared between those below 25years  and those above 75years old.
Cigna Insurance incurred the most cost while Aetna was the least. Cigna insurance spent the most for elective and emergency admissions while Medicare insurance spent the most on urgent admissions.The more the count of admission per insurance provider the higher the cost they incurred except between United Insurance and Blue Cross where higher count did not equal higher cost.

Hospital stays, admission count, and healthcare costs in general went through a sudden spike in late 2019 to early 2020,  this spike was sustained at a certain threshold over 2021 to 2023 and then began to nosedive as we progressed into 2024.

The general profile for Admission type showed elective admissions were the highest, followed by urgent and emergency admissions respectively. The trend for the admission type was similar for the active population where they had more elective admissions, followed by urgent ones then lower emergency admissions but the population above 75years had more urgent admissions, followed by emergency ones then lastly the electives. The youngest population was completely different, they had more emergency admissions, followed by urgent ones then lastly the electives.

The gender of patients did not reflect the usual female dominant pattern as males were slightly (48 more males) than females in number. The youngest patient seen was 13 years old while oldest  patient was 89years. As expected over 51% of patients were above 50years old while, ages 25-50 made up about 38% and ages below 25 were about 11%.
The male gender recorded higher Diabetes, High blood pressure, Asthma, Cancer cases than the females while the females recorded higher Arthritis and Obesity cases but in general, Arthritis, Diabetes, High blood pressure topped the chart.

Across the blood group O+ had the lowest reports of Cancers, B+ had lowest report of Asthma and Hypertension, O- had lowest report of Diabetes, A+ had the lowest report of Arthritis and  AB+ had lowest report of Obesity. Having either of blood groups O and A-show lower occurrence of the health problems identified.

# Recommendations
The Insurance company can utilize the above information to target and provide health information and services to the older population who are major consumers of the health services.
The gender-specific information and services could be tailored to suit the different gender due to illnesses common among them.
Proactive measures and information to curb emergencies could be put in place. Actions could be taken to educate and proactively target clients who could end up with emergencies

# Limitations
This is not real-life data so the assumptions are not representative of  real situations.
The analysis was mainly exploratory.
